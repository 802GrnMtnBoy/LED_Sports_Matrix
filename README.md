# LED_Sports_Matrix
A python project using a Raspberry Pi Zero with an Adafruit Hat to power a 32x64 LED Matrix with various sport data and weather information!

# Disclaimer
I am in no way a professional at coding in Python (still learning) and am well aware that my code may not be considered "standard" or follows best practicies. But I do welcome anyone who would like to contribute to this project, make it better or more streamlined with more efficient code.

I will be adding to the ReadMe file as time allows me
